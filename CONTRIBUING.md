## How to

### Opening an issue

Before opening an issue, please check that the issue is not already opened.
If the issue exists but it was closed, you can re-open the issue and/or add more information about it.
If there is no issue similar to yours, feel free to create an issue and follow the template.

### Creating a pull request

Once you have finished your development and you want to merge it, please create a pull request. The pull request must have an explicit title, for example: `feat(frontend): <your feature>`. Once the pull request is created, follow the template.

### Developing a new feature

You have a new feature to develop?<br>
Let's start by opening an issue with the feature template.<br>
Then create a branch from develop, which should be named `feat/<your ticket title>`.<br>
Now you can start coding :)


## Code rules

We use the [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) rules and name the arrays with the suffix `List` (example `serverList`).
